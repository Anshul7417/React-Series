//react is a js library.react cant directly connect to database it is possible through api only.

// react uses virtual dom--------srf utna hi load hogi jitna change hua hai...released in 2013

//react js can be used without npm node by using only cdn(content delievery network).

//npm is a tool that is used to install packages.Npx is a tool that is used to execute packages..npm alternative is yarn which is of facebook.

//change package.json and then use install uninstall to do anything.

//use run while using custom commands

//component---A piece of code that can reuse..powerful than functions.........many types----functional class HOC pure controlled uncontrolled

we can also define components inside components but then that component must be used inside only it parents..

React and angular can be used parallely.

JSX means javascriptXML.

React can be used without jsx but its complicated.
ex--React.createlement

jsx can be used without js

state is a object which stores data.component understands very well that state has been updated but it cant understand variables are updated or not.

it is because of react working method.It always re renders when there is a change in state...state can always be used inside component(but there is a way)

State is public.

props are parameters send to components.

usestate cant be used in class components

props can always be changed from the parent component sender not receiver

function can also be sent as props and this is called lifting up state

we can html as props...this.props.children for class component and props.children for functional component

we can also send data without form tag

React lifecycle has three states(phases)----

Mount,update,unmount

Life cycle method runs when component is loaded,component is Updated,component is Removed.

We cant use lcm directly in fc...it can be implemented with hook.constructor is a first life cycle method.

super calls the parent constructor of Component class.

Lifecycle will run again in any scenario.

Do no call api in constructor.Constructor hmesha phle chlta hai so state whi define kro taaki html load hone se phle state bn jaye but api call mt kro vrna speed gir jayegi as data comes slow from api.Api call in componentDidMount

Render life cycle method gets called everytime when props/states are changed. 

props can also be used in constructor.

componentDidMount--------no effect of state and props...it is called after html(dom) is ready.It is used for api.Jo chizo ki html pr dependency rehti hai unko krwaenge bd m iski help se.ex-----hide show krna nhai but html abhi ready hi nhi h tb kraenge use

phle render fr cdm

agr state change hui toh cdm nhi chlega kyunki vo bss html k load hone k bd hi chlega

ComponentdidUpdate tbhi chlega jb koi state update hogi ya props update honge.phle render fr CDU...if we update state in cdu it will go in infinite loop so it will use with condition only........Api call ho skti hai condition k sth

Dont update state in cdu also.

shouldComponentUpdate mjhe kuch update krna hai ya nhi mtlb yeh puchta hai ki kya update krana hai...jb state ya prop update honge tbhi chlega yeh. By default It  stop rendering.agar return true bai tbhi state update hogi

componentWillUnmount needs two component.jb bhi component dom se remove krte hai css remove nhi tb component call hoga.Yeh dom k htne se just phle call hota hai

SCU phle call hoga fr CDU

jha hmara componentwill unmount hai bss vo call hoga

With hooks we can use class components features in functional components such as state life cycle pure component etc.

useEffect is the combination of three lcm componentDidMount ComponentdidUpdate and componentWillUnmount.

Hooks cant be used in class component

any css can be used together

we use map above loops to traverse bcoz return statement dont support loops

react uses key in array or list to identify better

app.js m function likho for better speed aur as a props pass kro comp m

pure component rendering k repetition ko rokta hai.agr state same hai toh rokega render hone se vrna by default hr br check krta hai ki kya change h kuch

usememo check krta hai ki kya chalana hai.kyunki by default bhtt kuch chl jata but vo verify krega ki kya chlna hai.

reactjs says dont use ref.ref k pss powwer h dom ko manipulate krne ki.it affects dom directly

forwardref use krte h jb button kisi component m ho aur component khi alg jisko manipulate krna hai.

controlled components handle through state while uncontrolled through dom

forwardref class component se bhi chl jayega.

HOC-takes component ,,,, returns component

switch srf pehla match krke render kradega.agr name same h toh

if parent has some data then in superchild we can get by context.it means mtlb parent se comp c ko dena h bina a and b ko diye.

p----a-----b-----c

useContext is used in contextapi consumer to prevent it from callback hell.

axios is used to get data from api.

in router if we use component with function then we can easily pass props.

diff bw render and components....
components m new create hota hai hr brrr.use in props passing
render m new nhi bnega agr same h toh.
